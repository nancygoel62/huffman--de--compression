hii this is an aticle about huffman

see we will get some trouble in undeerstanding the code which we have choosen
so i found one another it too long but easy to understand

according to new 
we dont use huf extension
we just open a txt for output and then we create our 1 byte combination of huffman code and then insert that in txt as simple only require bineary functions.. now

eg inputfile == asdfg
and a=01,s=10,d=11,f=001,g=1111;random code so in 
output file we will write=01101100 1111100 only two byte; hence compressed

and now at the time of decoding we will read the file bit by bit and then store it in a string 'A' and after reading each bit
we will call search function which will check wheather 'A' contain any valid code or ot from huffmancode table if yes then we just decode that 'A' and store in new txt file and then 'A'=0 . if suppose 'A' is not found then just continue until we get valid string .


link for the code just read encoder and decoder function which will look messy but when u will read u find lots of unuseful things so skip them and just read useful content and then reponse so thst we can go further and one more thing i am able to understand the logic but not able to write actully no compiller working properly . you try and then tell what to do further
